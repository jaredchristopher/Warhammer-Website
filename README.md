Goals: 
  1. Make a working Sign-In & Login page where a user can only login to the website if they have signed-up to the website.
  2. Hide a user's password via hashing to ensure the safety of their personal information when it is being viewed by an admin.
  3. Implement a Cookie system that logs out a user after a certain amount of time of inactivity
