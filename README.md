# Warhammer-Website

Created by Jared Christopher (jarchri@siue.edu)

Goals: 
  1. Make a working Sign-In & Login page where a user can only login to the website if they have signed-up to the website.
  2. Hide a user's password via hashing to ensure the safety of their personal information when it is being viewed by an admin.
  3. Allow an admin to login using the username, admin, and the password, admin, as well as provide the admin with their own key features        of the website that regular users do not have access to, which would be the ability to view some user information and the ability to        add, update, and remove items from tables stored in the websites database.

Folder and File Explainations:
- The 'PHP, CSS, & SQL Files' folder is strictly for convience as it groups up all related files together so that it is easier to navigate and view files of interest. For instance, every file that is utilized on the hompage is contained in the 'Homepage' folder.
  
- The 'Warhammer Website' contains all the PHP, CSS, and SQL files as well; however, it also contains every image used for the website. This folder's contents would be the one to copy and use in order to test this website as it is originally intended.
